## What is QEWD?

In summary: [QEWD](http://qewdjs.com) is a Node.js-based platform for developing and running both interactive WebSocket-based applications and REST APIs.  QEWD can run as either a monolithic back-end or as a set of MicroServices.

QEWD uses a [unique architecture](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/having-your-node-js-cake-and-eating-it-too-799e90d40186)
 that prevents CPU-intensive or long-running APIs bringing a Node.js system to its knees, 
and includes [QEWD-JSdb](https://github.com/robtweed/qewd-jsdb), a powerful high-performance, 
tightly-integrated multi-model database which, uniquely, presents your data as persistent JavaScript Objects.


## Try it out

The quickest way to try out QEWD is using the pre-built Docker version.

    docker pull rtweed/qewd-server

There's also a Raspberry Pi version

    docker pull rtweed/qewd-server-rpi

Create three files within a folder of your choice (eg *~/myQEWDApp*), using the sub-folder structure shown below:

        ~/myQEWDApp
            |
            |_ configuration
            |            |
            |            |_ config.json
            |            |
            |            |_ routes.json
            |
            |_ apis
            |    |
            |    |_ helloworld
            |            |
            |            |_ index.js


### *config.json*

      {
        "qewd_up": true
      }


### *routes.json*

      [
        {
          "uri": "/api/helloworld",
          "method": "GET",
          "handler": "helloworld"
        }
      ]


### *index.js*

      module.exports = function(args, finished) {
        finished({
          hello: 'world'
        });
      };


Fire up the QEWD Docker instance:

    docker run -it --name qewdup --rm -p 3000:8080 -v ~/myQEWDApp:/opt/qewd/mapped rtweed/qewd-server

or on a Raspberry Pi:

    docker run -it --name qewdup --rm -p 3000:8080 -v ~/myQEWDApp:/opt/qewd/mapped rtweed/qewd-server-rpi


Try out your REST API:

    http://{{host-ip-address}}:3000/api/helloworld

*eg*:

    http://192.168.1.100:3000/api/helloworld
